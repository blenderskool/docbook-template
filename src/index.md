# DocBook site

Welcome to your DocBook website :tada:. This website is going to be amazing!

## Getting Started
Start by editing the `index.md` file in `src` folder. The development server would auto-reload to reflect the changes.  
By creating new markdown(.md) files in the `src` folder, new pages can be created.
